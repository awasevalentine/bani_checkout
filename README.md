# Note for Bani Africa

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and Tailwindcss template.

## I intentionally allowed the .dotenv field to be push, so you can use the configuration for the test


### Things that are missing
currently, the solution is not having responsiveness introduced.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
